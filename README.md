## cleanup - (3.0)

### DESCRIPTION

If you are using text editors like Emacs or Gedit your filesystem will be polluted with backup/swap files `~`. Cleanup will scan your `home/` directory recursivly and remove all of them in a few milliseconds.

### BUILD

Cleanup needs a working C++ toolchain and [CMake][cmake], in addition it depends on the following libraries:

* [Boost][boost]
* [TBB][tbb]

#### Ubuntu (14.04)
Install the prerequisite:

```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake libtbb-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-serialization-dev
```

To compile and install the program to `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thfabian/cleanup
cd cleanup
mkdir cleanup/build && cd cleanup/build
cmake ../
make
sudo make install 
```
